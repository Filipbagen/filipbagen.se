                <p>
                    Hey there! My name is Filip and I'm a soon-to-be <b>engineer in Computer Science</b>,
                    living in Sweden. I've always been facinated by the endless possibilities that
                    Artificial Intelligence offers and I've found that my <b> passion for web design and
                        project management </b> perfectly complements my love for technology. I'm a firm believer
                    that the ability to be curius and to learn new skills is the key to success.
                    <br /><br />
                    When I'm not studying, you can find me <b> building on my own projects </b> using my skills in design and
                    code development. I find it incredibly fascinating how <b>technology and design can work together</b> in order to create
                    something truly beautiful and functional. My earlier work combined with my curiosity have given me <b>valuable experience</b> in
                    developing and deploying production-level code. I am always eager to learn more
                    and take on new challenges.
